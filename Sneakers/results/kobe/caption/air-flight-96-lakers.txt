Air Zoom Flight 96 'Kobe Bryant' | SKU: 317980 100 | Released: nan


The 1995 Air Zoom Flight was one of the first Nike models to popularize their cutting-edge Zoom Air technology. The 2014 Air Zoom Flight 96 'Kobe Bryant' sneaker updates the 90s classic with a colorway inspired by the Lakers team colors when Bryant was drafted in 1996. The heel is stitched with the number eight, a nod to Black Mambaâ€™s original jersey number. Below sits a speckled, icy outsole.
