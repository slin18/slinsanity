Air Force 1 Supreme '07 'Kobe' | SKU: 315095 221 | Released: 2007-03-17


Kobe Bryant has had an affinity for Air Force 1s throughout his entire career, whether that was wearing his own low-top Player Exclusives or wearing them on court with the Lakers while he was in between shoe brands. This iteration of the Air Force 1 Supreme ’07 features a premium leather application throughout the upper with a graphic of Kobe’s face embroidered onto the side. The shoe was also originally released in a 25th Anniversary Air Force 1 collection that included other NBA players, like Rasheed Wallace, Vince Carter, and Shawn Marion.
