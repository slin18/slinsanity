Air Jordan 3/8 Retro 'Kobe Pack' | SKU: 869802 907 | Released: 2016-02-14


Distributed strictly to friends and family in 2016, the Air Jordan 3/8 Retro ‘Kobe Pack’ was designed to commemorate Kobe Bryant’s illustrious NBA career. The two-piece set brings together Lakes-inspired colorways of the Air Jordan 3 and 8, replicating two of the iconic PE models that the Mamba wore during the 2002-03 season, a period in which the athlete was essentially a sneaker free agent. The Air Jordan 3 utilizes a white tumbled leather upper with grey elephant-print overlays at the toe and heel. A gold Jumpman outlined in purple is embroidered on the tongue, complementing a second Jumpman logo on the molded heel tab. The Air Jordan 8 features similar color blocking, highlighted by a white leather upper with contrasting purple and gold accents throughout.
