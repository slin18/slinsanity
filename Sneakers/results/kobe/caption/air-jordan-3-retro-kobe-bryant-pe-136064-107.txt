Air Jordan 3 Retro 'Kobe Pack' | SKU: 136064 107 | Released: nan


Kobe Bryant was a free agent during the 2002-2003 NBA season and didnâ€™t have commitments with any sneaker brand. During this time, Jordan Brand gifted Kobe with exclusive designs, including the Air Jordan 3 Retro 'Kobe Bryant' PE. The sneaker boasts iconic elephant print elements, as well as a Home White leather upper and Lakers-inspired gold and purple details on the heel, eyelets, Jumpman logo, and lining. Part of the Kobe Jordan pack, alongside an Air Jordan 8 Retro PE, these were never released to the public and only gifted to friends and family.
