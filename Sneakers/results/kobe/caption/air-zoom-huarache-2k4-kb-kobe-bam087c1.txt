Air Zoom Huarache 2K4 Kb 'Kobe' | SKU: BAM087C1 | Released: nan


The Nike Air Zoom Huarache 2K4 KB 'Kobe' is an eponymous homage to the NBA champion and his legendary career leading the Los Angeles Lakers. Clad in jersey-inspired colors, this unreleased edition's nubuck upper nods to the 1992 Air Flight Huarache with a deconstructed collar, a molded external heel cup and a toe guard. The unmistakable 90s-born logo details the tongue. A Zoom Air midsole provides a smooth, responsive ride on a multi-treaded rubber outsole.
