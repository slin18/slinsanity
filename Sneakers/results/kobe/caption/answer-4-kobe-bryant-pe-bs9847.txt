Answer 4 'Kobe Bryant' PE | SKU: BS9847 | Released: 2018-02-16


When Kobe Bryant, otherwise known as The Black Mamba, didn’t yet have a new sneaker contract with any company, Reebok gave him a special colorway of the Iverson Answer 4. The Answer 4 'Kobe Bryant' PE features a white tumbled leather upper with purple leather accents on the mudguard, toe box, lining, and pull tabs. The basketball shoe is laceless, and boasts grey detailing throughout the midsole and midfoot, “I3” branding on the sides, and face logo on the outsole.
