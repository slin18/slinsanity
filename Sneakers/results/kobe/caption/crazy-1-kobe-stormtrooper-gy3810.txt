Crazy 1 Kobe 'Stormtrooper' 2022 | SKU: GY3810 | Released: 2022-12-17


The adidas Crazy 1 ‘Stormtrooper’ brings back an OG colorway of the hoops shoe originally dubbed the Kobe 1, worn by Kobe Bryant during the 2000 – 2001 NBA season. The unconventional design features a molded synthetic upper in a crisp white finish, marked with debossed three-stripes on the quarter panel and contrasted by black mesh on the tongue and collar. The sneaker rides on a matching white EVA midsole, supported underfoot by a midfoot shank and herringbone-traction rubber outsole.
