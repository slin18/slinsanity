Crazy 1 'Regal Purple' | SKU: GY8944 | Released: 2022-12-03


The adidas Crazy 1 ‘Regal Purple’ brings back the silhouette that Kobe Bryant wore when he clinched his first NBA championship. The retro model makes use of a purple synthetic upper, accented with debossed Three-Stripes and made in part with recycled content generated from production waste. A padded black mesh collar delivers a comfortable fit, while the abbreviated shell toe provides added support and durability. A metallic pewter finish is applied to the EVA midsole, reinforced underfoot by a black herringbone-traction rubber outsole.
