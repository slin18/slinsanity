Crazy 1 'Sunshine' 2022 | SKU: GY3808 | Released: 2022-12-10


The 2022 edition of the adidas Crazy 1 ‘Sunshine’ brings back an OG colorway of the shoe formerly known as the Kobe 1. Worn by Kobe Bryant at the 2001 NBA All-Star Game, the sneaker features a minimalist shape inspired by the Audi TT Roadster. A golden yellow hue floods a smooth synthetic upper with a reinforced toe bumper and debossed three-stripe branding on the quarter panel. Lightweight cushioning arrives via a full-length EVA midsole, supported underfoot by a herringbone-traction rubber outsole with adidas’ Torsion plate for midfoot support.
