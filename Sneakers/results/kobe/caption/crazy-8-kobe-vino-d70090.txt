Crazy 8 'Kobe Vino Pack' | SKU: D70090 | Released: 2016-05-05


adidas released the Crazy 8 ‘Kobe Vino’ in April 2016 as a tribute to Kobe Bryant, who finished his NBA career that month. Bryant’s first signature silhouette, originally known as the KB8, is finished in a burgundy shade, with cork detailing on the tongue. The design reflects Kobe’s other nickname—Vino—which suggests that he got better with age.
