Crazy 97 EQT Elevation Kobe Bryant '1997 All Star' | SKU: GY9125 | Released: 2022-07-22


The adidas Crazy 97 EQT Elevation ‘1997 All Star’ brings back the vintage silhouette that Kobe Bryant made famous. The model was worn by Kobe during his award-winning performance at the 1997 NBA Dunk Contest, and that year’s All-Star Game inspires the shoe’s distinctive color scheme. The upper combines black mesh quarter panels with synthetic leather overlays in aqua and metallic silver. A ‘1997’ pull tab is affixed to the tongue, featuring an orange holographic badge that alternates between adidas and Feet You Wear branding. The sneaker rides on a sculpted EVA midsole, supported underfoot by a speckled herringbone-traction rubber outsole.
