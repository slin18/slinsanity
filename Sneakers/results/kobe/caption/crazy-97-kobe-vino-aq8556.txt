Crazy 97 'Kobe Vino Pack' | SKU: AQ8556 | Released: 2016-05-05


The ‘Vino’ pack is the Three-Stripes’ tribute to Kobe Bryant who’s earned the nickname ’Vino’ for the way he’s gracefully aged into his court career. Like the Kobe, KB8 2, and Top Ten 2000 models in the series, this version of the Crazy 97 takes on a wine-inspired colorway that includes cork detailing over the tongue, Three-Stripes branding, and adidas logos at the ankle. The limited edition look is complemented by metallic silver accents on the midsole and an icy translucent outsole.
