Zoom Kobe 1 Protro 'Final Seconds' | SKU: AQ2728 101 | Released: 2018-04-14


The Zoom Kobe 1 Protro 'Final Seconds' celebrates Kobe Bryant’s heroic performance in Game 4 of the 2006 first round Western Conference Playoffs against the Suns. In the 4th quarter, Bryant hit a last-second one-handed layup to tie the game and take it into overtime. The Lakers then found themselves down by one point with 6.1 seconds left on the clock. Again, the Lakers got the ball to Bryant from a tip, and he drove across the court to the right and drained a game-winner over two defenders to beat the buzzer and seal a famous 99-98 win, and a 3-1 series lead. Based on the Lakers’ home-team jerseys from that season, the colorway sports a white leather upper with Del Sol and Varsity Purple accents. It also features Kobe’s number 8 jersey number embroidered on the heels and a full-length Zoom Air sole. The shoe was part of the Nike, Converse, and Jordan ‘Art of the Champion’ pack, a 16-shoe collection celebrating 16 iconic performances by 16 of the game’s greatest champions.
