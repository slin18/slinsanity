Kobe 10 'Liberty' | SKU: 705317 002 | Released: 2015-11-11


Given its name and black and Radiant Emerald shades, the ‘Liberty’ colorway of the Kobe 10 is said to be inspired by the Philadelphia Eagles, Bryant’s hometown football team. The low-cut sneaker features a textile and mesh upper above a translucent Lunarlon-cushioned midsole. A carbon fiber shank is embedded on the lateral side of the forefoot, and Kobe Bryant branding appears on the heel and tongue.
