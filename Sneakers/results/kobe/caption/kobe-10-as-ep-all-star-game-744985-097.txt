Kobe 10 EP 'All Star' | SKU: 744985 097 | Released: 2015-02-13


The Nike Kobe 10 AS EP ‘All Star Game’ released in February 2015 as part of a larger footwear collection celebrating the NBA’s annual exhibition event, held that year in NYC. Each pair took inspiration from the architecture of the Big Apple, with the Kobe 10 giving the nod to the Unisphere, unveiled at the 1964 World Fair, through a metallic silver finish on the heel panel, Swoosh, and tongue. The low-top’s midsole features gradient coloring, contrasting a basic black finish up top.
