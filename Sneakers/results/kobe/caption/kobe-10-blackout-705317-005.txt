Kobe 10 'Blackout' | SKU: 705317 005 | Released: 2015-02-21


The 2015 ‘Blackout’ edition of the Kobe 10 refers not to the color, but to Bryant’s tendency to push himself to near-blackouts during training. In contrast with its namesake, the mesh upper is dressed in a vibrant Persian Violet with hits of black. A matching Persian Violet translucent layer covers the natural-motion outsole while accenting a visible Zoom Air unit at the heel.
