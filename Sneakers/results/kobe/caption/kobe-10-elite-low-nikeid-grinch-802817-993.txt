Kobe 10 Elite 'Grinch' iD | SKU: 802817 901 | Released: 2015-12-22


For a limited time starting in December 2015, Nike customers were able to create the Kobe 10 Elite Low iD ‘Grinch’ through the brand’s custom NIKEiD platform. The shoe’s moniker takes inspiration from the bright green hue on its Flyknit upper, which recalls the namesake Dr. Seuss character. It also replicates the distinctive look of the Kobe 6 ‘Grinch,’ released as part of a Christmas pack in 2010.
