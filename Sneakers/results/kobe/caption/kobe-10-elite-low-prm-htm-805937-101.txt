Kobe 10 Elite Premium HTM 'Shark Jaw' | SKU: 805937 101 | Released: 2015-10-01


Hiroshi Fujiwara, Tinker Hatfield and Mark Parker’s collaborative iteration of the Kobe 10 Elite Low HTM plays to the idea of Kobe’s killer instincts on the court. The ‘Shark Jaw’ fashions Kobe’s signature shoe with a white and black design that’s highlighted by a translucent blue outsole. That same outsole sports Nike Free siping in the flex grooves. Borrowing from the Nike Free collection, the shoe combines Lunarlon and Zoom Air, while a Flyknit application, highlighted by Flywire technology, reinforces a locked-down fit up top.
