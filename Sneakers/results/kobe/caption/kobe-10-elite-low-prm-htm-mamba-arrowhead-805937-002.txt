Kobe 10 Elite Premium HTM 'Arrowhead' | SKU: 805937 002 | Released: 2015-10-01


The design collective HTM—Hiroshi Fujiwara, Tinker Hatfield and Mark Parker—joined forces for this ‘Mamba Arrowhead’ colorway as part of a three-shoe HTM collection for the Kobe 10 Elite Low. The shoe features a black Flyknit upper with heathered grey contrast stitching on the toe, accented with a metallic silver Swoosh and HTM branding on the heel. Underfoot the design sets itself apart with a speckled Lunarlon midsole that sports a Volt Zoom Air unit in the heel, finished with an icy blue translucent outsole.
