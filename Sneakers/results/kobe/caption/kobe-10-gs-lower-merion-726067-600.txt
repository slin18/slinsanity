Kobe 10 GS 'Lower Merion' | SKU: 726067 600 | Released: 2015-07-27


Debuted in July 2015, the Nike Kobe 10 GS 'Lower Merion' kids' sneaker tributes Bryant's high school alma mater by utilizing its colors as the defining aesthetic. Bold Swooshes and laces starkly contrast the technical mesh partial bootie. A heel logo and scale motif cut into the tongue symbolize the legend's alter ego, Black Mamba. Full-length Lunarlon midsole cushioning and a Zoom heel unit energize the translucent rubber outsole.
