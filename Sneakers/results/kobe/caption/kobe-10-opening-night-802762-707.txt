Kobe 10 Elite 'Opening Night' | SKU: 802762 707 | Released: 2015-11-27


Designed by Eric Avar, the Kobe 10 Elite was the first Flyknit basketball shoe constructed from recycled polyester yarn, with the equivalent of five plastic bottles being reused for each pair. This ‘Opening Night’ edition dropped shortly after the start of the 2015-2016 NBA season, Bryant’s last as a pro. The high-top features a Tour Yellow Flyknit upper with black accents and a speckled black midsole, reflective 3M accents on the Kobe sheath on the tongue and a gold Roman numeral X on the heel of the outsole.
