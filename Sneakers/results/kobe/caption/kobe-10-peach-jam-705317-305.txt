Kobe 10 'Overcome' | SKU: 705317 305 | Released: 2015-08-27


In the latter part of his NBA career, Kobe Bryant experienced a number of injury-plagued seasons. Nike dropped this ‘Overcome’ edition of the Kobe 10 to recognize Bryant’s resilience. The low-cut sneaker brings a multicolored pattern to the translucent textile upper, while Emerald Glow and Court Purple shades line the Lunarlon sole. A carbon fiber shank is embedded in the forefoot.
