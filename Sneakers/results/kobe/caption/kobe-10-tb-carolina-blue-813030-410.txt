Kobe 10 TB 'Carolina Blue' | SKU: 813030 410 | Released: 2015-11-01


The Kobe 10 TB 'Carolina Blue' boasts the colorway of a college Kobe Bryant would have considered attending had he not went straight from high school to the NBA. The Kobe 10 was designed by Eric Avar and first seen in early 2015. This shoe, dressed in a scheme of Carolina Blue, Metallic Silver and white, stays true to that model with its low-top design, signature detailing and lightweight textile upper. A white midsole provides contrast, while the outsole with its enhanced traction is in translucent blue.
