Kobe 11 Elite Low 'Eulogy' | SKU: 822675 510 | Released: 2016-02-27


A tribute to Kobe Bryant’s legendary career, the Nike Kobe 11 'Eulogy' sneaker was one of the final colorways he wore in his last NBA season. Released in February 2016, it sports a Hyper Grape, Black and White colorway that’s inspired by the team colors of the Los Angeles Lakers—the team Bryant played for his entire career. It features a gradient Flyknit upper with a White Swoosh and matching Kobe logo on the tongue. Mismatched heel counters feature red stitching on the left heel and the numbers ‘8’ and ‘24’ on the right—a nod to the jersey numbers he sported while playing.
