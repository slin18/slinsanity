Kobe 11 Elite Low 'Achilles Heel' | SKU: 822675 670 | Released: 2016-01-09


The Nike Kobe 11 ‘Achilles Heel’ sneaker is released in a black and red gradient colorway for January 2016, paying respect to the Greek god, Achilles, and Kobe’s season-ending surgery in 2013. The upper introduces an even stronger version of Flyknit technology, fused with TPU threads for extra elasticity and resistance to oil, grease and abrasion. The high-performance design boasts a full-length Lunarlon foam and Air Zoom unit, with an embossed graphic of Achilles on the right heel counter.
