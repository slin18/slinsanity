Kobe 11 'Carpe Diem' | SKU: 836183 015 | Released: 2016-05-21


The colorway on this Kobe 11 was originally popularized by the Kobe 4 ‘Carpe Diem’ in 2009 which is credited for kickstarting the transition to low-top footwear on the court. Seven years later, Nike reran the iconic look on this Kobe 11, giving it the same Lakers color scheme, grid stitching along the interior, and translucent sole.
