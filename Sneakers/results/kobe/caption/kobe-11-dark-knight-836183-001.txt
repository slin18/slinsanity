Kobe 11 'Dark Knight' | SKU: 836183 001 | Released: 2016-07-09


The Nike Kobe 11 underscores the dedication to innovation that cemented the signature line's design legacy. This 'Dark Knight' variant—debuting in July 2013—champions the All-Star's love for Batman in a covert mesh, synthetic skin and textile upper. A Black Mamba logo on the tongue nods to Bryant's personal narrative. Full-length Lunarlon midsole foam and a Zoom Air unit in the heel return energy over a translucent rubber outsole.
