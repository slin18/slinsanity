Kobe 11 'Draft Day' | SKU: 836183 154 | Released: 2016-04-28


Inspired by the 1996 NBA Draft, which saw the Charlotte Hornets select Kobe Bryant before immediately trading him to the Los Angeles Lakers, the Kobe 11 implements Charlotteâ€™s team colors, featuring a series of purples and teals that contrast the grey Engineered Mesh upper. Flywire cables on the eyelets promote greater forefoot support, while the Lunarlon cushioning system promotes a cushioned ride.
