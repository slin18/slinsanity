Kobe 11 'Barcelona' | SKU: 836183 806 | Released: 2016-10-15


Having spent most of his childhood in Italy, Kobe Bryant grew up a soccer fan. It’s fitting that the Nike Kobe 11 ‘Barcelona’ sneaker follows the colors of FC Barcelona—one of Bryant's favorite teams. Released in October 2016, the sneaker features an Engineered Mesh upper, sleek and streamlined in a bright Mango and Crimson combination. A black lateral Swoosh and black Kobe logo on the tongue provide contrast.
