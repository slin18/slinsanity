Kobe 11 '3D' | SKU: 836183 084 | Released: 2016-07-27


Playful in its inspiration, the polka-dot printed graphics of the Kobe 11 EM Low '3D' sneaker is inspired by optical illusions and 3D movie lenses. Released in July 2016, it sports an allover spotted pattern that pairs Total Crimson and Chlorine Blue hues together for a 3D effect on its engineered mesh upper. Alternating red and blue Swoosh branding on its sidewall complement the mismatched heel counters, while an icy translucent midsole and outsole complete the look.
