Kobe 11 'Invisibility Cloak' | SKU: 836183 005 | Released: 2016-11-01


With the Kobe 11 EM Low ‘Invisibility Cloak,’ Nike revisits a design theme popularized on the Kobe 7. The low-top features a black mesh upper accented with shifting blue and purple hues on the fused paneling, as well as pops of Hyper Pink on the Flywire cables and Kobe logo on the tongue. An icy translucent outsole provides traction, while a drop-in Lunarlon sockliner delivers a cushioned ride.
