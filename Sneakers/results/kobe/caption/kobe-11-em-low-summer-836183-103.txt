Kobe 11 'Summer' | SKU: 836183 103 | Released: 2016-08-31


The Nike Kobe 11 EM Low 'Summer' features a colorway that hints at the colors of the country where Kobe Bryant grew up—Italy. The white engineered mesh upper has hits of green—albeit in an aqua tone that deviates from the traditional Italian version—on the Swoosh and collar, while an orange-red peeks out on the branding and lace loops. Below, the midsole-outsole comes in a gum rubber that wraps up the side for extra support.
