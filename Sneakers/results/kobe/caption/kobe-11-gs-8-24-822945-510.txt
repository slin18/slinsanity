Kobe 11 GS '8 24' | SKU: 822945 510 | Released: 2015-11-27


Made for big kids, the Nike Kobe 11 GS ‘8 24’ celebrates Kobe Bryant’s legacy with the Los Angeles Lakers. In addition to the Hyper Grape finish on the breathable Flyknit upper, the heel tab on the right shoe is embellished with ‘8’ and ’24,’ the jersey numbers that the Mamba wore during his storied NBA career. Underfoot, an icy translucent rubber outsole reveals the drop-in Lunarlon midsole, equipped with Zoom Air cushioning in the heel.
