In Greek mythology, the Achilles heel is the fatal weak spot of an undefeated warrior. For Kobe Bryant, it refers to his season-ending injury in 2013. As a nod to his recovery, Nike released the Kobe 11 GS 'Achilles Heel.' The sneaker features a Flyknit upper dressed in a University Red and black color scheme,TPU yarn for superior structure and support, and a Zoom unit at the heel for responsive cushioning. The low top also sports a graphic of the God Achilles on the right heel, four stitches on the left heel, and a metallic gold Kobe shield logo on the tongue.
