Kobe 11 GS 'Oreo' | SKU: 822945 100 | Released: 2016-09-24


The Nike Kobe 11 ‘Oreo’ released in September 2016 as a grade school exclusive. The design lives up to its moniker through a blend of white and black yarns on the Flyknit upper, accented by solid black hits on the tongue, laces and embroidered Swoosh. The white speckled midsole underfoot houses a Zoom Air unit in the heel, which acts in concert with a drop-in Lunarlon sockliner for lightweight cushioning.
