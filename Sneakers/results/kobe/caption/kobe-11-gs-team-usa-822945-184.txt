Kobe 11 GS 'Team USA' | SKU: 822945 184 | Released: 2016-07-18


The Nike Kobe 11 GS ‘Team USA’ launched in July 2016 in anticipation of the Rio Summer Olympics the following month. Constructed with a lightweight knit build, the low-top is finished in a patriotic red, white and blue color scheme. Nods to Kobe Bryant arrive on the heels, including four stitch marks on the left heel as an allusion to the four feet of sutures used in Bryant’s 2013 Achilles surgery. The numbers ‘08’ and ‘12’ are embroidered on the right heel, representing the Olympic years in which Kobe won gold medals with the US Men’s National Team.
