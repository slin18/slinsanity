Kobe 11 GS 'TV' | SKU: 822945 002 | Released: 2016-05-27


This version of the Kobe 11 dropped in 2016 exclusively in grade school sizing. A nod to the television theme, the heel section of the shoe dons multi-colored bars reminiscent of the Technicolor logo of the ‘90s as well as a static-inspired Flyknit upper pattern in shades of Wolf Grey and Cool Grey. The shoe’s look is completed by a translucent outsole.
