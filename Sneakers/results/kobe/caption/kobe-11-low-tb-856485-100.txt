Kobe 11 TB 'White' | SKU: 856485 100 | Released: 2016-10-01


The Nike Kobe 11 Low TB ‘White’ dropped in 2016 as one of six Team Bank styles featuring a simple two-tone design.

A drop-in Lunarlon sockliner offers lightweight cushioning, while an icy translucent rubber outsole provides grippy traction on the hardwood.
