Kobe 11 TB 'Black' | SKU: 856485 001 | Released: 2016-10-01


While most editions of the Kobe 11 come with a Flyknit upper, this promo model features a more traditional mesh construction. The lightweight layer conceals Flywire cabling at the midfoot, while targeted panels reinforce the toe and heel. The midsole is lined with Lunarlon foam. Kobe branding, incorporating four red lines on the left (signaling his stitches and comeback from an achilles injury) and his signature on the right, appear on the heels. The Kobe 11 TB Promo dropped in summer 2016 as part of the Team Bank collection.
