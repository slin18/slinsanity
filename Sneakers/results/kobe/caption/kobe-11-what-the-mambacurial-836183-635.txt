Kobe 11 'Mambacurial' | SKU: 836183 635 | Released: 2016-09-15


The Nike Kobe 11 ‘Mambacurial’ sneaker features a breathable woven Flyknit fabrication and a gradient color scheme. Originally seen on the Kobe 8, the Pink Flash and Action Green combination quickly became one of the most coveted Kobe colorways, a nod to the Mercurial soccer boot that inspired the design. In this minimal low-top iteration, an oversized ‘NIKE’ logo decorates the medial side, with a mountain-like translucent Action Green overlay accenting the midsole.
