Zoom Kobe 5 'Wolf Grey' | SKU: 386429 006 | Released: 2010-09-18


The Nike Zoom Kobe 5 'Wolf Grey' provides a low-top silhouette with a colorway of Wolf Grey, black and Daring Red. Released in 2010 and designed by Eric Avar, this shoe is lighter and lower than earlier Kobe signatures, a change inspired by what the Los Angeles Lakers great saw soccer players wearing. It features Kobe's 'Sheath' branding on its tongue, a mostly grey upper and Bryant's signature on the heel. A black, Phylon-injected midsole with red speckles on the back half and Nike Zoom units in the heel and forefoot round out the look.
