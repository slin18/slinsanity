Zoom Kobe 5 'Aston Martin' | SKU: 386429 004 | Released: 2016-05-14


In 2008, Kobe Bryant jumped over a speeding Aston Martin DB9 Volante to promote Nike’s new Hyperdunk shoe. This limited edition 2016 Kobe 5 ‘Aston Martin’ colorway pays tribute to Kobe’s stunt with its Anthracite upper, red accents based on the car’s leather interior and an outsole that resembles black rubber car tires.
