Kobe 6 GS '3D/Hollywood' | SKU: 429913 006 | Released: nan


This Kobe 6 gives a '3D/Hollywood' colorway to a model that honors Kobe Bryant's iconic alter ego. 'The Black Mamba' comes to life on this shoe with a polyurethane 'island' upper that has the look and feel of snakeskin. Released in February 2011, the sneaker is dressed in Dark Grey, Chlorine Blue and Daring Red, a nod to the vibrant scene in the Los Angeles area. While the Nike Swoosh is displayed in blue on the right foot, it appears in red on the left, both surrounded by 3-D imagery.
