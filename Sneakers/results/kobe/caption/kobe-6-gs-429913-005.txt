Zoom Kobe 6 GS | SKU: 429913 005 | Released: nan


This Nike Zoom Kobe 6 GS debuted in 2011 with a colorway of black, Metallic Silver, Concord and white. Sized for kids and designed by Eric Avar, its look was inspired by Kobe Bryant's nickname, 'The Black Mamba.' This is seen on the majority of the upper with its snakeskin-like upper and the front of the outsole, where the word 'VENOMENON' is displayed. A white midsole provides contrast, while Concord and black return for the outsole with its 'Sheath' branding.
