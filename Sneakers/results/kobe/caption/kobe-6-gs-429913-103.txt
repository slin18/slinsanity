Kobe 6 GS 'White Del Sol' | SKU: 429913 103 | Released: nan


The Nike Kobe 6 GS presents a strong connection to Kobe Bryant's legendary nickname, 'The Black Mamba.' Released in 2011, this kids' sized shoe possesses a colorway of white, black, Del Sol and Neutral Grey, and features a snakeskin-like design on its upper. Another nod to Bryant's alter ego is the word 'VENOMENON' on the front of the midsole. Completing the lightweight style is Kobe's signature on the heel and a black outsole designed to provide comfort and support.
