Zoom Kobe 6 GS 'All Star - Orange County' | SKU: 429913 800 | Released: nan


The Nike Zoom Kobe 6 GS 'Orange County' pays tribute to one of Kobe Bryant's homes during his NBA playing career. Dressed in a colorway of Orange Peel, Cannon and black, this kids' shoe is an updated take on the Zoom Kobe 6, which was first seen during the 2010-11 season. Like the original, this lightweight low top features a polyurethane 'island' upper, a nod to Kobe's 'Black Mamba' nickname. The Nike Swoosh appears in grey with a sunset-inspired background beneath it. Closing out the look is a black midsole and translucent outsole.
