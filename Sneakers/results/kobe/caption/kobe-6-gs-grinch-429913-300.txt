Kobe 6 GS 'Grinch' | SKU: 429913 300 | Released: nan


The Nike Kobe 6 GS ‘Grinch’ was officially named the ‘Green Mamba,’ but its Christmas Day 2010 debut and colorway reminiscent of the iconic curmudgeon led fans to dub it the ‘Grinch.’ The bright green coloring on the shoe’s upper is complemented by a scaly reptilian texture, reflective of Nike’s intention for the design to be a nod to the green mamba—a variation on Kobe’s ‘Black Mamba’ nickname.
