Kobe 7 GS | SKU: 505399 501 | Released: nan


This Nike Kobe 7 comes sized for kids in a familiar colorway with distinguishing marks. Dressed in shades of Kobe Bryant's team for 20 NBA seasons—Court Purple, Wolf Grey, True Yellow and black—this shoe was released in 2012 as part of the 'Poison Dart Frog' pack. A frog pattern takes over the black and yellow upper, which also features yellow Flywire. An image of a frog appears on the heel, just below Kobe's signature. A purple midsole dominates the bottom portion of this low-top sneaker and a grey outsole completes the look.
