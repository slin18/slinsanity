Kobe 8 'Green Glow' | SKU: 555035 304 | Released: 2013-12-02


An obvious reptilian theme is showcased on the Nike Kobe 8 ‘Green Glow’ from December 2013. The tongue tag depicts a snake wrapped around Kobe’s personal logo, while a snakeskin print, finished in a blend of Green Glow and Mineral Teal, covers the Engineered Mesh upper. Contrast coloring arrives via pops of Laser Orange on the branding elements and outsole.
