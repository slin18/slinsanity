Kobe 8 System 'Mine Grey' | SKU: 555035 003 | Released: 2013-11-30


The Kobe 8 ‘Mine Grey’ puts the titular color on its Engineered Mesh upper, the first of its kind on a basketball shoe. The colorway sports a graphic snakeskin print, with Court Purple emerging on the laces and branding and University Red appearing on the 3D heel counter. A full-length Lunarlon midsole promotes a cushioned ride, while the snake motif also makes its way to the snake-scale traction pattern underfoot.
