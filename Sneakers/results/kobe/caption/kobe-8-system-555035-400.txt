Kobe 8 System 'Blue Coral Snake' | SKU: 555035 400 | Released: 2013-02-23


Featuring a low-profile and lightweight build, the Nike Kobe 8 System plays off Kobe’s Black Mamba persona with this ‘Blue Coral Snake’ colorway, highlighted by a subtle snakeskin print on the Engineered Mesh upper. Contrasting Strata Grey makes its way onto the signature Swoosh and rubber outsole, which combines classic herringbone and snake scale-inspired traction patterns.
