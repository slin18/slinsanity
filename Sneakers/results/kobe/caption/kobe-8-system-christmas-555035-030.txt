Kobe 8 System 'Christmas' | SKU: 555035 030 | Released: 2012-12-26


The Kobe 8 System marked the first time Nike incorporated its Engineered Mesh technology into a basketball shoe. Combined with no-sew synthetic overlays and a Lunarlon sole, the 2012 release is an exceptionally lightweight sneaker. To celebrate Christmas that same year, Nike dropped this festive rendition of the Kobe 8 System, complete with a bold, colorful upper inspired by the rhinoceros viper.
