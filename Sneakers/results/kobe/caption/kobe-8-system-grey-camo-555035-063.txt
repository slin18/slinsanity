Kobe 8 System 'Grey Camo Volt' | SKU: 555035 063 | Released: 2013-03-09


Weighing in at just 9.6 ounces, the Kobe 8 System was inspired by Kobe Bryant’s Black Mamba nickname, featuring a snakeskin pattern throughout the upper. The Engineered Mesh marks the first ever incorporation of the technology on a basketball shoe, and a Lunarlon midsole sits underfoot for cushioning and comfort. The outsole’s herringbone pattern factors in a snake scale design for multi-directional traction—and a final thematic touch.
