Kobe 8 System 'Prelude' | SKU: 639655 900 | Released: 2014-01-25


The Nike Kobe 8 System ‘Prelude’ showcases an abstract swirling design inspired by contemporary art on its Engineered Mesh upper. A mirror-like finish on the molded heel counter is meant to symbolize the period of reflection that Kobe endured following his injury-plagued 2012-2013 season. The unique design is finished with a vibrant pop of Volt on the Swoosh, as well as gradient shades of red and purple on the outsole.
