Kobe 9 Elite 'Fade To Black' | SKU: 869455 002 | Released: 2016-04-11


In honor of Kobe Bryant’s retirement from the NBA, Nike released a ‘Fade to Black’ edition of the Kobe 9 Elite. The ‘Fade to Black series takes a look back at Kobe’s complete line of footwear before Kobe would officially hang up his jersey. Featuring a Flyknit upper construction, the design is contrasted with tonal branding on the Swoosh and Mamba logo, while the mono-sockliner extends beyond the height of the ankle for a snug and stable fit.
