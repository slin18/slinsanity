Kobe 9 Elite GS 'Fundamentals' | SKU: 636602 100 | Released: nan


The Kobe 9 was Nike’s first basketball shoe to feature Flyknit technology, with a seamless upper that wraps the forefoot and Flywire cables to help create a locked-down fit. The shoe’s high-top makeup rests on a Lunarlon cushioning system for comfort. The metallic gold Swoosh reaches from the Flyknit upper to the graphic overlay on the heel.
