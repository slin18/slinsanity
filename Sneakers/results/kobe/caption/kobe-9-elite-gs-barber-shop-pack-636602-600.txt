Kobe 9 Elite Gs 'Barber Shop' | SKU: 636602 600 | Released: 2014-05-15


This special Kobe 9 Elite was released in 2014 as part of Nike Basketball’s popular ‘Barber Shop’ pack of grade-school-size silhouettes. Like the accompanying LeBron 11 and KD 6, the Kobe 9 Elite sports colors and stripe patterns reminiscent of a classic barber’s pole. Unlike the other silver-dipped designs in the series, this high-top stands out in Laser Crimson with black and turquoise accents.
