Kobe 9 Elite 'Masterpiece' | SKU: 630847 001 | Released: 2014-02-08


The result of a collaboration between Nike designer Eric Avar and Kobe Bryant, the Kobe 9 Elite silhouette receives a colorful highlight with the Kobe 9 Elite ‘Masterpiece.’ The bright, multicolor Flyknit upper stands out against the black base of the shoe, which is also highlighted by metallic silver. Underfoot, a Lunarlon insert sits atop a thin web outsole, while a red line accent on the heel serves as a nod to Kobe’s return from a torn Achilles.
