Kobe 9 EM GS Deep 'Garnet' | SKU: 653593 601 | Released: 2014-04-25


Made for big kids, the Nike Kobe 9 EM GS ‘Deep Garnet’ draws inspiration from Kobe Bryant’s alma mater, Lower Merion High School, located in the suburbs just outside Philadelphia. The school’s signature burgundy hue is applied to the engineered mesh upper, while ‘1996’ is inscribed in gold on the tongue tag — the year Kobe led the Aces to a state championship. Vibrant pops of Hyper Crimson stand out on the sneaker’s Flywire cables and rubber outsole.
