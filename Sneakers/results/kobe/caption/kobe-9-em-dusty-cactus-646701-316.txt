Kobe 9 EM 'Dusty Cactus' | SKU: 646701 316 | Released: 2014-10-03


The Nike Kobe 9 EM appears with a Dusty Cactus hue on the Engineered Mesh upper, which creates a blend of forefoot support and breathability. The red accents on the branding match the Flywire cables, which reinforce the shoe with a locked-down fit. The outsole traction pattern is designed to mirror the shape of an actual foot, with pressure-mapped cushioning pods throughout.
