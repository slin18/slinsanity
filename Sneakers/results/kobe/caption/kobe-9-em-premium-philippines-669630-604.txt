Kobe 9 Em Premium 'Philippines' | SKU: 669630 604 | Released: 2014-05-23


The limited-edition ‘Philippines’ edition of the Kobe 9 released in 2014 exclusively to those with a special Twitter link. The woven upper sports a distinct print by half-Filipino designer Erick Goto that pays homage to basketball culture in Southeast Asia. Unique flip-flop detailing on the icy translucent outsole is a nod to those who find a way to play the game even if they’re unable to afford basketball shoes.
