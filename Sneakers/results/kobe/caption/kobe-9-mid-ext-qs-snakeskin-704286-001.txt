Kobe 9 Mid EXT QS 'Snakeskin' | SKU: 704286 001 | Released: 2014-08-23


Nike Basketball and Nike Sportswear team up to create the Kobe 9 Mid EXT QS 'Snakeskin' sneaker—Kobe Bryant’s ninth model for his signature sneaker line. Released in August 2014, this exotic edition swaps out the Flyknit upper for a synthetic black leather that’s imprinted with a textured snakeskin print. Reflective chrome detailing on the shoe’s tongue and midsole provide an eye-catching accent, while a gum rubber outsole finish off the look of this ultra-sleek design.
