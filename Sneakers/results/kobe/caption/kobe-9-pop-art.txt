Kobe 9 EM 'Pop Art' | SKU: 646701 508 | Released: 2014-05-17


The Kobe 9 EM features a ‘Pop Art’ theme throughout the Engineered Mesh application on the upper, which builds on past releases referencing different eras of art. Flywire cables along the eyestay enforce a locked-down fit, while the pressure-mapped outsole features a footprint design that’s intended to increase traction on court.
