Kobe A.D. 2018 'Moon Particle' | SKU: AV3555 004 | Released: 2018-09-20


Following Kobe Bryant’s retirement from the NBA, his signature shoe line still wanted to showcase performance technology as if Kobe was still playing in them. This Kobe A.D. 2018 follows that trend. Although adopting a similar shape to previous designs, it showcases materials and cushioning that offer maximum performance with a lightweight design, with a slip-on construction and a minimalist lacing system. Kobe’s high school and professional jersey numbers—33, 08, 24—appear on the tongue of the left shoe, while his date of birth—08, 23, 78—appears on the right.
