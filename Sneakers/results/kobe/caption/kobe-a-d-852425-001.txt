Kobe A.D. 'Black White' | SKU: 852425 001 | Released: 2016-12-16


In 2016, Bryant’s twelfth signature silhouette became the first to ditch number categorization, opting for the name ‘Kobe A.D.’ in acknowledgement of his retirement from the game. Using a classic black and white color combo, it debuted contemporary construction consisting of an Engineered Mesh upper with Dynamic Flywire for lockdown support, a Zoom Air-equipped Lunarlon foam midsole, and a grippy outsole micro-tread traction.
