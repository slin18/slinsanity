Kobe A.D. 'City of Compton' | SKU: 942301 900 | Released: 2017-04-12


Inspired by DeRozan’s early memories of watching Kobe Bryant play as a Laker from his hometown in Compton, Demar DeRozan used Kobe’s progression as fuel to motivate his own NBA career. Featuring a tonal grey upper, the shoe is blocked with yellow, purple, and light blue accents throughout the Mamba branding to signify the DeRozan’s earliest recollections of Kobe, where he and the Lakers took on the Utah Jazz in the 1997 Semi-Finals.
