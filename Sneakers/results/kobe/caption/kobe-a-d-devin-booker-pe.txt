Kobe A.D. 'Devin Booker' PE | SKU: AQ2721 500 | Released: 2018-04-16


Released in April 2018, this Nike Kobe AD was a PE created for Phoenix Suns shooting Guard Devin Booker. In March 2017 Booker became the youngest player to score over 60 points in a game at 20 years of age. His 70 points against the Boston Celtics also enrolled him in the exclusive six-member 70 club with Wilt Chamberlain, David Robinson, David Thompson, Elgin Baylor, and Kobe Bryant. The Phoenix Suns-inspired colorway features a Pro Purple upper with an orange midsole and icy blue translucent outsole. It also comes with screen-printed photos of Booker on the Nike Swoosh and insole.
