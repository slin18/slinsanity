Kobe A.D. 2018 EP 'Moon Particle' | SKU: AV3556 004 | Released: 2018-11-01


Kobe Bryant’s retirement from the NBA in 2016 inspired Nike’s collaborative effort with the Black Mamba on the Kobe A.D. Released in October 2018, the Kobe A.D. EP 'Moon Particle' sneaker expands the 18-time All-Star’s signature lineage. The low-top is outfitted in a light color palette with a ventilated mesh upper and Flywire cables for reinforced support. The flex-grooved Lunarlon midsole works with the grip traction outsole for responsive comfort.
