Kobe A.D. 2018 EP 'Vivid Purple' | SKU: AV3556 002 | Released: nan


The Nike Kobe A.D. EP ‘Deep Purple’—a late summer 2018 version of Kobe Bryant’s post-retirement signature shoe—resembles Kobe models of the past, with a low-cut silhouette and plenty of Kobe branding, but it also showcases newer elements including a white band across the forefoot, a set of significant numbers on the tongue lace loops and a wide lacing system. The lightweight upper combines black, purple and white with hints of yellow, while the sole adds gray and a few more pops of purple to complete this Laker-centric design.
