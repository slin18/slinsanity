Kobe A.D. 'Flip the Switch' | SKU: 852425 004 | Released: 2017-05-05


Introduced in May 2017, the Nike Kobe A.D. 'Flip the Switch' sneaker is primed for the NBA postseason with unique traits associated with Bryant's charge to the championship. The nubuck and synthetic upper flaunts a bold tongue, a fractured lateral Swoosh and an ombre external counter with a sheath logo. A coiled snake and script logo embroider the heel patches. Zoom Air, Lunarlon midsole cushioning and the rubber outsole remain.
