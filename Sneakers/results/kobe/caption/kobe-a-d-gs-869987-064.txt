Kobe A.D. GS 'Triple Black' | SKU: 869987 064 | Released: nan


This is the kids’ edition of the Nike Kobe A.D. that released in May 2017. The low-top sports a blacked-out design, featuring a sleek upper constructed from a combination of synthetic and knit materials. Kobe Bryant’s personal logo adorns the tongue, sockliner and translucent outsole. The athlete’s signature is embroidered in red on the heel tab of the right shoe, while its counterpart features a double-helix symbol formed by two intertwined snakes—a nod to the idea of the shoe having Black Mamba DNA.
