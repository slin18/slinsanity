Kobe A.D. GS 'Midnight Navy' | SKU: 869987 406 | Released: 2017-02-01


The first signature Kobe model to debut after Kobe Bryant’s retirement, the Kobe A.D. appears in a ‘Midnight Navy’ rendering throughout its breathable mesh upper. The Swoosh and Kobe branding provide contrast, while the shoe sits on a hybrid midsole that combines Zoom Air and Lunarlon foam. Dynamic Flywire cables promote a locked-down fit, and a translucent, micro-tread outsole provides traction underfoot.
