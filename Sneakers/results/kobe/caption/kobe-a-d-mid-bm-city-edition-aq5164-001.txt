Kobe A.D. Mid BM 'City Edition' | SKU: AQ5164 001 | Released: 2017-12-26


Designed with L.A. basketball fans in mind, this Kobe AD ‘Black Mamba’ joined Nike’s ‘City Edition’ pack in late 2017. The Lakers-inspired silhouette features familiar University Gold and black colors along with the words “BLACK” and “MAMBA” on the left and right tongues written in an unmistakable Lakers font. Continuing the team tribute, embroidered drop-shadow Swooshes and a matching outsole are both presented in University Gold.
