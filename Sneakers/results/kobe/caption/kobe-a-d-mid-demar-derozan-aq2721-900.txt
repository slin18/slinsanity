Kobe A.D. Mid 'DeMar DeRozan' PE | SKU: AQ2721 900 | Released: 2018-03-18


The Nike Kobe A.D. Mid sneaker gets a double athlete collaboration with the 2018 ‘DeMar DeRozan’ PE model. The Player Exclusive shoe features an insole with a split image mashup of Kobe in his Olympics jersey and DeRozan in his Raptor’s uniform, both sporting the number 10, which is referenced again with the '10/10' emblem on the heel counter. Classic Kobe touches are seen throughout: a snake scale print on the upper for Kobe's nickname ‘Black Mamba’ and the athlete’s signature on the tongue.
