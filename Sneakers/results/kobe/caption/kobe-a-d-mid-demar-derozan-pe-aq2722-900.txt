Kobe A.D. Mid EP 'DeMar DeRozan' PE | SKU: AQ2722 900 | Released: 2018-03-18


Designed to Bryant's demanding specifications, the Nike Kobe A.D. Mid EP 'DeMar DeRozan' PE sneaker is a symbol of his impact on the All-Star's career. The suede and synthetic upper alludes to the Black Mamba persona with a snake graphic. Woven Swooshes create contrast while a '10/10' heel mark represents DeRozan’s jersey number and Kobe’s Olympic uniform. For sure-footed responsiveness, a Lunarlon midsole and translucent rubber outsole merge.
