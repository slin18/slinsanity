Kobe A.D. NXT 360 'White Multicolor' | SKU: AQ1087 102 | Released: 2018-08-01


Released about two years after Kobe Bryantâ€™s retirement from the NBA, the Black Mamba is still trying to get his signature sneaker to have maximum performance output for players that wear his Kobe line. The Kobe A.D. NXT 360 features a 360-degree white Flyknit upper with multicolor accents around the collar and a translucent orange heel. The sneaker also boasts a dual-density foam midsole with Nike React technology and Lunarlon underfoot. A Kobe-inspired pattern adorns the Emerald Green outsole.
