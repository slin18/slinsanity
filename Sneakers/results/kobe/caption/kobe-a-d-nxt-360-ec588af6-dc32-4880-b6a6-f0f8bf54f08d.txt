Kobe A.D. NXT 360 'Mamba Day' | SKU: AQ1087 001 | Released: 2018-04-13


Kobe Bryant may have stepped away from the game, but not from his keen design eye for his footwear line. The Nike and Kobe partnership continues with the Kobe A.D. NXT 360, featuring a black 360Â° Flyknit upper that offers a more precise fit. A drop-in sockliner serves as the midsole and cushioning elements, with a combination of Lunar and React foam present throughout offering full-length support. It dropped for Mamba Day in 2018 alongside the Nike Kobe 1 Protro.
