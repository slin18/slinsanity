Kobe A.D. NXT 360 'Infrared' | SKU: AQ1087 100 | Released: 2018-06-14


While Kobe Bryant’s NBA career may be over, his signature A.D. line of Nike footwear continues to channel his on-court performance and quick-strike playing style. The Kobe A.D. NXT 360 'Infrared' has a Flyknit upper with a practically seamless construction across the silhouette. The edges of the outsole are equipped with Nike React foam for greater bounce, while Lunarlon cushioning adds even more comfort. Kobe’s signature appears on the silver heel counter.
