Kobe A.D. NXT 'University Red' | SKU: 882049 600 | Released: 2017-07-15


Matching the colors of the Raptors jersey, this University Red colorway of the Kobe A.D. NXT was worn by DeMar DeRozan, who epitomizes the Mamba Mentality. The Nike Kobe A.D. NXT appears with a seamless knit design and tonal red hues throughout the upper. Contrasted with a black sock-liner and midsole, the shoe is also juxtaposed with a reverse Swoosh that features a speckled detailing. Removing the standard laces for a toggle fastening system ensures a snug fit and reduces forefoot irritation.
