After Kobe Bryantâ€™s illustrious career, the MVP and NBA champion joined forces with Nike to create the future of his signature line, the Kobe A.D. collection. Nike adds a bold take to the line with the Kobe A.D. NXT 'Volt' sneaker. Released in April 2017, the neon sneaker is made with a Flyknit upper for lightweight breathability, strengthened by toggle pull locks for additional support. Nike Zoom Air cushioning enhances the midsole for responsive comfort.
