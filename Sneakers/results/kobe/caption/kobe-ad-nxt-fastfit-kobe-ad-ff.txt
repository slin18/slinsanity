Kobe AD NXT FastFit 'Off Noir' | SKU: CD0458 090 | Released: 2019-08-24


The Kobe AD NXT FastFit released on August 24, 2019, displaying Kobe Bryant's obsession with quickness and stability through a high-tech design that offers complete control at high speeds. A FastFit system from the Jordan 33 secures the foot, and the shoe's interior workings can be seen through a translucent Swoosh logo at the side. To take on the repeated impacts of the game, a QuadFit construction and React foam deliver responsive support without extra bulk.
