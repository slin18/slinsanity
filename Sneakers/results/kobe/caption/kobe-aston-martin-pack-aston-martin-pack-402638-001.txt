Kobe 'Aston Martin Pack' | SKU: 402638 001 | Released: 2016-05-14


In 2010, Nike partnered with Aston Martin to launch the limited Kobe ‘Aston Martin Pack,’ inspired by a 2008 viral ad depicting Kobe Bryant leaping over a speeding Aston Martin DB9 Volante. The featured silhouettes take the form of a Nike Zoom Kobe V and a Nike Hyperdunk—the shoe Kobe wore in the video—with both finished in metallic Anthracite and leather interiors. Dual Nike and Aston Martin branding adorns the sockliner of both pairs as well as the tongue of the Hyperdunk.
