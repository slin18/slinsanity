Zoom Kobe 6 'Prelude' | SKU: 640220 001 | Released: 2014-01-11


The Kobe 6 ‘Prelude’ is part of an eight-shoe capsule that features Kobe’s history of signature shoes with Nike leading up to the launch of the Kobe 9. With a graffiti design depicting everything from palm trees to sharks, the ‘Prelude’ edition of the Kobe 6 draws inspiration from the eclectic Venice neighborhood of Bryant’s longtime home of Los Angeles. The colorful graphics adorn a snakeskin textured upper, while a Zoom Air midsole and stabilizing heel counter provided added support.
