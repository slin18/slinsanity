Kobe 10 PS | SKU: 726068 403 | Released: nan


This Nike Kobe 10 PS delivers a colorway of Blue Lagoon, Vapor Green and black in kids' sizes. Released in 2015 and designed by Eric Avar, Kobe Bryant's tenth signature shoe with Nike is a low-cut, lightweight sneaker that promotes durability and responsiveness. Blue covers the tongue, laces and translucent textile upper, while the Nike Swoosh appears in black. The left shoe's heel counter displays four red lines—a nod to Bryant's ACL surgery in 2013 when four feet of threading was used to repair his tendon—while the right shoe features 'The Sheath' logo.
