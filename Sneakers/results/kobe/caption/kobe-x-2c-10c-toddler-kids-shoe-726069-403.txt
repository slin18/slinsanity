Kobe 10 '5AM Flight' TD | SKU: 726069 403 | Released: nan


The Nike Kobe 10 '5AM Flight' TD draws inspiration from a moment that took place in 2013 as Kobe Bryant recovered from ACL surgery. One morning, Bryant jumped from a 40-foot diving platform into a pool, hence the Blue Lagoon that coats most of the shoe. Vapor Green and black round out the colorway of this kids' size sneaker, which was released in 2015. Kobe's signature is featured on the tongue, the Nike Swoosh appears in black on the quarter panel and a blue outsole completes the style.
