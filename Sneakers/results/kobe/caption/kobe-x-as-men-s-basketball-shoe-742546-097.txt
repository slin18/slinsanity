Kobe 10 'All Star' | SKU: 742546 097 | Released: 2015-02-13


Part of Nike’s NBA All Star collection in 2015, this special edition of the Kobe 10 looks to the architecture of New York city for inspiration, specifically the Unisphere from the New York World’s Fair. Dubbed the ‘Zoom City’ colorway, the design sports a seamless textile upper, stylized heel tab, metallic silver tongue, and Volt-to-orange gradient on the semi-translucent midsole.
