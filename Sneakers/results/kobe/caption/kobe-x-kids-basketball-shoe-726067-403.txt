Kobe 10 GS '5AM Flight' | SKU: 726067 403 | Released: nan


The first colorway of Nike’s Kobe 10 to be released, the ‘5AM Flight’ memorializes Bryant’s early morning leap off of a 40-foot diving board, made famous on the video platform Vine. The most obvious nod to the event comes via the Blue Lagoon that covers the knit upper and translucent outsole, the latter revealing a white midsole. A gold ‘X’ is emblazoned on the bottom of the sole, with Kobe’s signature appearing across the tongue in red.
