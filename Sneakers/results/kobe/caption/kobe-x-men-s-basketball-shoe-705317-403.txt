Kobe 10 '5AM Flight' | SKU: 705317 403 | Released: 2015-02-07


The Kobe 10 '5 AM Flight’ was the first colorway for Kobe Bryant’s 10th signature shoe. It references his early morning 40-foot leap from a diving board in August 2013 after recovering from surgery to his Achilles tendon. It features a Vapor Green and Blue Lagoon seamless engineered mesh upper with a snake-scale pattern on the nubuck tongue. The left heel comes accented with four red lines to represent the four feet of stitching required to repair the tendon, while the icy blue translucent outsole features a gold ‘X’ beneath the heel Zoom unit.
