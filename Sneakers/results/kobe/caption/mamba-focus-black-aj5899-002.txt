Mamba Focus 'Black' | SKU: AJ5899 002 | Released: 2019-03-26


Known as one of the greatest basketball players of all time, Kobe Bryant led the Los Angeles Lakers to five NBA championships and won the MVP award in 2008. Bryant’s self-proclaimed ‘Black Mamba’ moniker became the name for his signature collaboration with Nike. Numerous silhouettes have joined the Mamba line, including the March 2019 reveal of the Mamba Focus ‘Black.’ This rendition is complete with a low-profile construction and snakeskin-inspired outsole.
