Mamba Focus 'Lakers' | SKU: AJ5899 005 | Released: 2019-09-01


Revealed in August 2019, the Nike Mamba Focus 'Lakers' pays homage to Kobe Bryant's time leading the Los Angeles squad in jersey-inspired colors. The sneaker is clad in a black embossed upper— inspired by a snake’s metamorphosis—with purple tongue branding, a molded external heel cage and bright medial Swoosh. A Zoom Air midsole and split-colored rubber outsole promote a responsive reaction and control on the court.
