Mamba Focus 'Metallic Gold' | SKU: AJ5899 004 | Released: 2019-09-21


Nike's Mamba Focus symbolizes Kobe Bryant's on-court transition to his alter ego. Updated in September 2019, this edition mimics a snake's metamorphosis in an embossed textile upper constructed with film overlays, an external heel cage and TPU eyelets inspired by reptilian eyes. Bryant's emblem on the tongue and a Swoosh outrigger are done in metallic gold. The sneaker utilizes a Zoom Air-boosted midsole and icy translucent rubber outsole.
