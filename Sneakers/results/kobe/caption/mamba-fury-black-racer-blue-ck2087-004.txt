Mamba Fury 'Black Racer Blue' | SKU: CK2087 004 | Released: 2020-10-23


The Nike Mamba Fury ‘Black Racer Blue’ delivers a sleek colorway of a performance hoops shoe named after Kobe Bryant’s competitive spirit. The stripped-down black textile build is accented with a royal blue Swoosh on the lateral side, its surface marked with a scale pattern that extends up the quarter panel. Performance benefits include lace loops for midfoot lockdown and a TPU heel clip for rearfoot stability. Underfoot, a snakeskin-inspired traction pattern provides superior grip on the hardwood.
