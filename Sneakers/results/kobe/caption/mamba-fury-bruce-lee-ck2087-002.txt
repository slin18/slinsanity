Mamba Fury 'Bruce Lee' | SKU: CK2087 002 | Released: 2020-08-06


The Nike Mamba Fury ‘Bruce Lee’ delivers an alternate take on the classic Kobe 5 colorway inspired by the martial arts film star. The black textile upper is accented with a red Swoosh, its scaly texture extending up the sneaker’s side panel. Additional pops of University Red appear on the tongue, TPU heel clip and integrated lace loops. A forefoot Zoom Air unit is embedded in the foam midsole, reinforced by black and yellow rubber outsole with a snakeskin-inspired traction pattern.
