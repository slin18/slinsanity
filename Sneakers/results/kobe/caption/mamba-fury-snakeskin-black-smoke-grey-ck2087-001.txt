Mamba Fury 'Snakeskin - Black Smoke Grey' | SKU: CK2087 001 | Released: 2020-04-15


The Nike Mamba Fury ‘Black Smoke Grey’ applies a neutral color scheme to a low-profile hoops shoe built for speed and mobility. A reptilian texture distinguishes the textile upper, which sits atop a scaly midsole fitted with a Zoom Air unit in the forefoot. Kobe Bryant’s sheath logo adorns the tongue, heel and rubber outsole, the latter featuring a snakeskin-inspired traction pattern for enhanced grip on the hardwood.
