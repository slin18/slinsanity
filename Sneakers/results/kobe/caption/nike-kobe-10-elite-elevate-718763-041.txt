Kobe 10 Elite 'Elevate' | SKU: 718763 041 | Released: 2015-05-15


The Elite edition of the Kobe 10 modifies the original low-profile signature model, including a polyester yarn finish covering a significantly elevated high-top construction. The ‘Elevate’ model showcases a teal and Wolf Grey colorway across the Flyknit upper. A translucent Emerald Green midsole conceals a carbon fiber midfoot shank, while four red stripes—signifying Bryant’s 2013 Achilles injury—appear on the left shoe only.
