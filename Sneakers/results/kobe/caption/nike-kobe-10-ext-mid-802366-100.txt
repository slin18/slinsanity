Kobe 10 Mid EXT 'White Gum' | SKU: 802366 100 | Released: 2015-05-22


The Kobe 10 was designed for optimal performance on-court, but the EXT line lets the design shine in an off-court setting. This Kobe 10 EXT Mid is dressed in a simple white color scheme on a full-grain leather upper, but the details are really what make the shoe pop. Perforated ‘X’ rows covers the entire upper to provide hyper-breathability. The mid-top also boasts gold-plated details on the Kobe logo at the tongue, in the inner sleeve, and on the gum rubber outsole.
