Kobe 10 'Silk' | SKU: 705317 676 | Released: 2015-03-20


As a tribute to Kobe Bryant’s international life story, Nike released the ‘Silk’ edition of the Kobe 10 in 2015, named as a reference to the Silk Road, the historic trade network that connected Europe and Asia. The low-cut sneaker features a textile and mesh upper, a Lunarlon cushioned midsole and a carbon fiber shank in the lateral forefoot. As a further tribute to the ancient trade network, a floral print lines the underside of the tongue.
