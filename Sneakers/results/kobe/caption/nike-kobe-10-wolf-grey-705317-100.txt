Kobe 10 'Fundamentals' | SKU: 705317 100 | Released: 2015-05-21


Kobe’s tenth signature shoe alludes to the importance of fundamentals, adopting a simplistic white and black color scheme. Featuring a white mesh upper construction that adapts to the forefoot’s natural motion, contrast coloring arrives via the Swoosh and forefoot as well as the mismatched heel branding. The shoe is also layered with Lunarlon technology in the midsole for a responsive ride.
