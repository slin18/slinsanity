Packer Shoes x Question Mid 'For Player Use Only - Kobe Bryant' | SKU: V53581 | Released: 2013-10-14


In October 2013, Packer Shoes teamed up with Reebok to recreate the player exclusive Reebok Question Mid worn by Kobe Bryant during his sneaker free-agent season following his six-year contract with adidas. The Lakers-inspired colorway features a white leather upper with purple on the toe cap, heel patch and eyelets. Yellow Reebok branding throughout completes the themed look, while the midsole houses Hexalite cushioning. The heel sports ‘8,’ Kobe Bryant’s number at the time he first wore the shoe.
