Star Wars x Crazy 1 'Darth Vader' | SKU: EH2460 | Released: 2019-11-01


In November 2019, Star Wars and adidas collided once again to celebrate the theatrical premiere of the franchise's ninth episode in December with the Crazy 1. The sneaker is an homage to the Galactic Empire in black patent leather detailed with a graphic overlay, reflective laces and 'Action Red' lining. Nods to the autocratic regime include its emblem on the tongue and an Imperial rank plaque on heel. A matching midsole and bold rubber outsole round out the theme.
