Top Ten 2000 'Kobe Vino Pack' | SKU: AQ8539 | Released: 2016-05-05


The Top Ten 2000 'Kobe Vino’ was released in adidas’ 2016 sneaker pack paying tribute to Kobe Bryant’s career. Kobe wore the Top Ten 2000 in his debut season in the NBA, but this shoe references the ‘Vino’ nickname his friend coined in 2013, a tribute to his ability to improve with age like a fine wine. The upper features cork paneling underneath white overlays, supported by three midfoot straps. The design also includes a wine-label-style tongue logo, a padded collar and a herringbone outsole.
