Undefeated x Kobe 4 Protro 'Team Orange' | SKU: CQ3869 800 | Released: 2019-08-24


Released in August 2019 as one of four colorways, the Undefeated x Kobe 4 Protro 'Devin Booker' is presented in orange with purple accents, a nod to Booker's Phoenix Suns. The low-top sneaker features branding for both Kobe Bryant and Undefeated on the tongues as well as the sockliner. A patent leather upper blends well with the Flywire panels, and both of Kobe's jersey numbers, 8 and 24, can be seen on the back heel of the shoe.
