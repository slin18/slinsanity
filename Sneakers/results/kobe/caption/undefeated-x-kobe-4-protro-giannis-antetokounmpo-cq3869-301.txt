Undefeated x Kobe 4 Protro 'Fir' | SKU: CQ3869 301 | Released: 2019-08-24


The Undefeated x Kobe 4 Protro 'Giannis Antetokounmpo' gives a popular low-top silhouette first seen in 2008 an updated look and a colorway dominated with a solid green upper, a nod to Giannis' Milwaukee Bucks. Released in August 2019 on Mamba Day, this edition showcases Kobe's sheath logo on one tongue and the Undefeated logo on the other. The sneaker's patent leather upper displays the Swoosh in black, while Kobe's numbers, 8 and 24, appear on alternating heels. A white midsole and multi-colored outsole provide contrast.
