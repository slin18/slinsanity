Undefeated x Zoom Kobe 5 Protro 'Hall Of Fame' | SKU: DA6809 700 | Released: 2021-05-12


The Undefeated x Nike Zoom Kobe 5 Protro ‘Hall of Fame’ celebrates Kobe Bryant’s induction into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. As a nod to the Mamba’s championship pedigree, a metallic gold finish coats the upper, crafted from breathable mesh with snakeskin-textured leather overlays. Each shoe is accented with a purple Swoosh on the right side panel and a mismatched pink Swoosh on the left. Specific to the left shoe, the pink Swoosh is inscribed with the numbers 24, 10 and 8, representing the jersey numbers that Kobe wore with the Lakers and Team USA. Additional mismatched branding lands on the tongue and heel, both featuring Kobe’s personal trademark and Undefeated’s Five Strikes logo.
