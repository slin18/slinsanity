Undefeated x Zoom Kobe 5 Protro 'What If Pack - Dirty Dozen' | SKU: CZ6499 900 | Released: 2020-08-27


Made in collaboration with the LA-based retailer, the Undefeated x Nike Zoom Kobe 5 Protro ‘Dirty Dozen’ is drawn from the two-piece ‘What If Pack,’ inspired by the 1996 NBA Draft in which a 17-year-old Kobe Bryant was selected by the Charlotte Hornets with the 13th overall pick. The shoe’s multi-hued design features colors taken from the twelve teams that passed up on the Black Mamba, while metallic gold accents give the nod to the athlete’s championship pedigree.
