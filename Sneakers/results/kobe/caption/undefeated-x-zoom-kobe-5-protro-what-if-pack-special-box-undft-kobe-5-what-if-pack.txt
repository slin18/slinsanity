Undefeated x Zoom Kobe 5 Protro 'What If Pack' Special Box | SKU: DB5551 900 | Released: 2020-08-27


Designed in partnership with the LA-based retailer, the Undefeated x Nike Zoom Kobe 5 Protro ‘What If Pack’ brings together two colorways inspired by Kobe Bryant’s selection in the 1996 NBA Draft. The first pair features various hues taken from the 12 teams that passed on the Mamba, while the second is dressed in the colors of the Charlotte Hornets, the franchise that took the 17-year-old high schooler with the 13th pick. Both are accented with metallic gold detailing that celebrates Bryant’s five championships.
