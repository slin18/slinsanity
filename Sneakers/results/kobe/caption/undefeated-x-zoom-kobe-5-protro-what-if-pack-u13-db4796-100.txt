Undefeated x Zoom Kobe 5 Protro 'What If Pack - Unlucky 13' | SKU: DB4796 100 | Released: 2020-08-27


Made in collaboration with the LA-based retailer, the Undefeated x Nike Zoom Kobe 5 Protro ‘Unlucky 13’ is taken from the two-piece ‘What If Pack,’ inspired by the circumstances surrounding Kobe Bryant’s selection and subsequent trade in the 1996 NBA draft. This pair features a white and teal color scheme that gives the nod to the Charlotte Hornets, the team that drafted Bryant with the 13th overall pick. Metallic gold Swooshes celebrate the Black Mamba's five championships.
