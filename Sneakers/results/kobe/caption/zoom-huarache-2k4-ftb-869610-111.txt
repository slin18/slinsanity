Zoom Huarache 2K4 'Fade To Black' | SKU: 869610 111 | Released: 2016-03-22


Just before Kobe Bryant’s NBA career came to an end, Nike commemorated his many achievements with a ‘Fade to Black’ collection. The collection was comprised of various silhouettes, with each release in a darker makeup than its predecessor. The Zoom Huarache 2K4 was Kobe’s first signature silhouette with the Swoosh, and implements an all-white perforated leather upper with the Mamba logo on the side. Kobe’s logo appears on the custom leather hang-tag to tribute the beginning of Kobe’s Nike legacy during the 2003-04 NBA season.
