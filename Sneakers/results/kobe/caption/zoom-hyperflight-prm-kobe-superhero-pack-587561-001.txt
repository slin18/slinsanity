Zoom Hyperflight Prm 'Kobe Superhero Pack' | SKU: 587561 001 | Released: nan


Nike founder Bill Bowerman is known for pushing boundaries, and in 2001 Nike designer Eric Avar answered one of his questions—'can you make it lighter?'—by designing Nike Hyperflight. The Nike Zoom Hyperflight Prm 'Kobe Superhero Pack' expands on that legend with an ultralight synthetic upper decked out in black. The shoe features an iridescent green snake design and a slender rubber outsole befitting the lightweight silhouette.
