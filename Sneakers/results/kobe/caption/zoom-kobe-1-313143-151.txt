Zoom Kobe 1 QS 'China' | SKU: 313143 151 | Released: 2008-03-01


This Zoom Kobe 1 is an updated take on Kobe Bryant's first signature sneaker with Nike. It sports the same silhouette as the original, which was first seen in 2005 and designed by Ken Link. This version, with a colorway of white and Varsity Purple, features 'The Sheath' logo on its tongue. The Swoosh appears on purple, while Bryant's jersey number, 24, is displayed on the sneaker's premium upper. Purple also coats the midsole, while a translucent outsole finishes the style.
