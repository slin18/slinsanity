Zoom Kobe 1 'Del Sol' | SKU: 313143 013 | Released: 2006-10-01


The Nike Zoom Kobe 1 ‘Black Maize’ showcases contrasting hues on Kobe Bryant’s debut signature shoe with Nike, released in 2005 following a two-year period in which the Mamba wore various Air Huaraches and Air Jordans on the hardwood. The mid-top makes use of a black leather upper, accented with a contrasting white Swoosh and yellow textile collar. The latter hue is repeated on the midsole, enhanced with dual Zoom Air units and a carbon fiber shank.
