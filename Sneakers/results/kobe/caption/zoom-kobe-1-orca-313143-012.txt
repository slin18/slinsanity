Zoom Kobe 1 'Sharpshooter' | SKU: 313143 012 | Released: 2006-01-01


Originally released in 2005, the Ken Link-designed Nike Zoom Kobe 1 was Kobe Bryant’s first signature shoe with Nike. This 2006 Nike Zoom Kobe 1 ‘Orca’ edition gets its nickname from its resemblance to the black and white coloring of the killer whale. It boasts a black full-grain leather upper with white accents, a breathable collar and a carbon fiber heel counter for stability. It also features Zoom Air units in the forefoot and heel and a solid rubber outsole with a herringbone traction pattern.
