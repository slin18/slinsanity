Zoom Kobe 1 'Prelude' | SKU: 640221 001 | Released: 2013-12-07


The first ever retro of a signature Kobe sneaker, the ‘Prelude’ colorway of the Kobe 1 dropped in 2013 as a tribute to one of Bryant’s finest performances: scoring 81 points against the Toronto Raptors in 2006. The sneaker, in shades of black and grey, honors the achievement with a graphic print on the collar and Swoosh, while a snakeskin pattern emerges on the rest of the upper. A white patch, marked with ‘81pts’ in gold lettering, appears on the insole.
