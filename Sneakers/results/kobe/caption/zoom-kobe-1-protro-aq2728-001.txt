Zoom Kobe 1 Protro 'MPLS' | SKU: AQ2728 001 | Released: 2018-07-06


Released in July 2018, the Zoom Kobe 1 Protro ‘MPLS’ gives the nod to the only NBA franchise that Kobe Bryant ever played for, though this particular colorway predates the Los Angeles Lakers. The light blue coloring that accents the predominantly grey and white build pays homage to the Minneapolis Lakers, resulting in a blend of old and new that reflects the performance-retro concept of the shoe itself.
