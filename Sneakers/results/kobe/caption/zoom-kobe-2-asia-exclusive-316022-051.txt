Zoom Kobe 2 'Lakers Away' Asia Exclusive | SKU: 316022 051 | Released: 2007-01-01


The Nike Zoom Kobe 2 'Asia Exclusive' comes in a colorway of black, Grape Ice and Varsity Maize. This Asia-edition was released in 2007, one year after the Zoom Kobe 2 was first distributed. Designed by Ken Link, the shoe features a leather upper, ankle strap and 'The Sheath' logo in multiple locations. It was created with Nike Free and Nike Considered technology, both of which promote a natural fit. While most of the upper appears in black, the laces and stitching are yellow, and purple coats the Swoosh and midsole.
