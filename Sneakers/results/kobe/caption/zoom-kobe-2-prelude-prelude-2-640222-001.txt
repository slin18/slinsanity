Zoom Kobe 2 'Prelude' | SKU: 640222 001 | Released: 2013-12-14


The Zoom Kobe 2 ‘Prelude’ is part of an eight-shoe capsule that features Kobe’s history of signature shoes with Nike leading up to the launch of the Kobe 9. This particular silhouette features an all-over marble graphic that’s accented with gold tones on the eyelets and branding that was inspired by the Renaissance art period. The Zoom Kobe 2 has the number ‘4’ stenciled inside the strap, representing a stretch in 2007 where he scored at least 50 points in four straight games.
