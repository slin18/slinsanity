The ‘China’ edition of Kobe Bryant’s third signature shoe with Nike appears in the Los Angeles Lakers team colors, incorporating a high-top design that creates a sock-like fit. The metallic silver exterior cage stands out against the white base, while Canyon Gold and Varsity Purple complete the team look. Originally releasing in 2007, the shoe was only available at that season’s Kobe Event at the House of Hoops.
