The Nike Zoom Kobe 3 Sl 'MVP' celebrates Kobe Bryant and his 2007-08 season, in which he claimed the NBA's Most Valuable Player award. Released in May 2008 with a colorway of white, Varsity Purple and Varsity Maize, this Eric Avar-designed shoe is equipped with an underlying mesh upper that has an injected mold. The tongue's 'Sheath' logo is modified to include 'MVP,' while the Nike Swoosh appears in purple on the heel. This rare shoe, which Bryant wore during the 2008 NBA Playoffs, was designed to promote breathability and flexibility.
