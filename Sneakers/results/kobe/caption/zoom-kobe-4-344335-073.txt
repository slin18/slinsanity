Zoom Kobe 4 'Lakers Away' | SKU: 344335 073 | Released: 2009-11-10


Designed by Eric Avar, the revolutionary low-top cut of the Kobe 4 was inspired by Kobe Bryant’s experience playing basketball in soccer shoes when he was a kid in Italy. The shoe is supported by Flywire technology on the upper and Zoom Air underfoot. This Zoom Kobe 4 ‘Lakers Away’ released in September 2009 with a unique gradient fade on the upper, going from black at the top to Concord at the heel.
