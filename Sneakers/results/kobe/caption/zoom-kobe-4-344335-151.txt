Zoom Kobe 4 'Draft Day' | SKU: 344335 151 | Released: 2009-06-11


Designed by Eric Avar, the Kobe 4 revolutionized Kobe Bryant’s signature line with its low-cut construction. This 2009 Zoom Kobe 4 'Draft Day’ colorway commemorates the Charlotte Hornets’ fateful decision in the 1996 NBA Draft to trade Kobe Bryant for Los Angeles Lakers center Vlade Divac. The Charlotte Hornets-inspired color scheme features a white base, Varsity Purple on the Flywire cables and Swoosh and turquoise accents throughout, including the outsole. The date of the draft, 6-11-96, appears on the heel.
