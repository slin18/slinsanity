Zoom Kobe 4 'Chaos Joker' | SKU: 344335 051 | Released: 2009-01-18


The 2009 Zoom Kobe 4 'Chaos Joker’ pays tribute to Heath Ledger’s Oscar-winning performance in Christopher Nolan’s 2008 movie The Dark Knight. The colorway is based on the Joker's outfit, sporting a blend of metallic silver, Abyss and Nightshade as well as a purple silk-like material on the collar, toe box and tongue. The shoe is supported by Flywire technology, a Lunar Foam midsole and Zoom Air cushioning in the heel, while blood-spattered detailing emerges on both the insole and outsole.
