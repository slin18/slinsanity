Zoom Kobe 4 'Fade To Black' | SKU: 869450 005 | Released: 2016-03-30


This Nike Zoom Kobe 4 'FTB' features a monochromatic Dust Grey colorway with a Flywire upper, Lunar Foam midsole, and Zoom Air cushioning. The Kobe 4 was the first low-top version of the Kobe series and was worn by Bryant in 2009 for his fourth NBA title win against the Orlando Magic and his first Finals’ MVP Award. The sneaker dropped in March 2016 as part of Kobe’s ‘Fade to Black’ / ‘Black Mamba’ collection. The 13-part collection released special edition colorways for the entire Kobe signature shoe line, as well as the Hyperdunk and Huarache 2k4, leading up to Kobe’s last game in the NBA in April 2016.
