Zoom Kobe 4 Protro 'Lakers Away' PE | SKU: SP19 MNBSKT 761Z 925189 | Released: nan


The Nike Zoom Kobe 4 Protro 'Lakers Away' PE is a player exclusive shoe worn by Lakers forward Kyle Kuzma. Though Kuzma never shared the floor with Kobe Bryant—he was drafted in 2017, just over a year after Bryant played his final NBA game—he received his own colorway of the Zoom Kobe 4 that debuted in 2008. This colorway comes dressed in Field Purple, white and Amarillo. The low top features Kobe's 'Sheath' logo on the tongue, a lightweight upper made of leather and textile, perforations in the toe and a Zoom Air unit in the heel.
