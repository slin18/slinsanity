Zoom Kobe 4 Protro 'Draft Day' | SKU: AV6339 100 | Released: 2019-02-15


The Kobe 4 marks its retro return in the Zoom Kobe 4 Protro 'Draft Day' sneaker. Released in February 2019 for NBA All-Star Weekend, this shoe is a nod to basketball history. On June 26, 1996, high school senior Kobe Bryant was drafted by the Charlotte Hornets before being traded to the Los Angeles Lakers—a move that changed the course of Bryant’s life and two NBA franchises. A White, Orion Blue and Varsity Purple color palette and the draft date embossed on the heel pay tribute to this pivotal moment in basketball history.
