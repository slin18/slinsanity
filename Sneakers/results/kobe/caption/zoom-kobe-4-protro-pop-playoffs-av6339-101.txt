Zoom Kobe 4 Protro 'Del Sol' | SKU: AV6339 101 | Released: 2019-05-24


Continuing the series of Protros (performance retros), the Zoom Kobe 4 Protro 'Del Sol' sneaker updates the Eric Avar-designed Kobe 4 with this original colorway. Roughly translated to 'Coast of the Sun,' the 'Del Sol' edition is adorned with striking yellow accents at the collar, laces and Swoosh. This shoe was released in May 2019 and brandishes a glossy heel counter and smooth leather toe box. A two-tone theme takes over the shoe's modified herringbone tread.
