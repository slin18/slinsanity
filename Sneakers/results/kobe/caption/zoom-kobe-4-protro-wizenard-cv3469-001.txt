Zoom Kobe 4 Protro 'Wizenard' | SKU: CV3469 001 | Released: 2019-12-06


Anticipating the NBA marquee matchups that define the holiday season, Nike released the Zoom Kobe 4 Protro 'Wizenard' in December 2019. The multi-colored vibe is inspired by the book cover of 'The Wizenard Series - Training Camp,' created by Kobe Bryant. A tumbled-leather tongue and matte black heel cap lend a refined look. Performance benefits stay intact from the original shoe created by Eric Avar, including Flywire, Lunarlon foam and Zoom Air cushioning.
