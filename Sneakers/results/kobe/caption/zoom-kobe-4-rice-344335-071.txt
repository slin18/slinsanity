Zoom Kobe 4 'Rice Away' | SKU: 344335 071 | Released: 2009-09-05


Designed by Eric Avar and Tom Luedecke and launched in 2008, the Nike Zoom Kobe 4 was the first Kobe sneaker to be released in low-top form. This 2009 Zoom Kobe 4 ‘Rice’ was created for Rice High School, a private Roman Catholic prep school in Harlem. The shoe’s black upper is accented with hits of Forest Green and Varsity Maize and supported by Flywire cables. Kobe Bryant’s signature emerges on the heel counter, and ‘Rice’ is featured on the heel patch. Underfoot, a Lunarlon midsole is complemented by Zoom Air cushioning.
