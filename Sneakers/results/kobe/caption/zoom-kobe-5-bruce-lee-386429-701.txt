Zoom Kobe 5 'Bruce Lee' | SKU: 386429 701 | Released: 2010-02-06


Stepping off the hardwood, the Nike Zoom Kobe 5 ‘Bruce Lee’ pays homage to the iconic action film star. The shoe’s distinctive design pays homage to two films from Lee’s 70s filmography. The yellow colorway is directly inspired by the one-piece jumpsuit that Lee wore in Game of Death, while the red scratch marks on the lateral side give the nod to the final fight scene from Enter the Dragon.
