Zoom Kobe 5 'Lower Merion Aces Home' | SKU: 386429 106 | Released: 2010-09-10


The Nike Zoom Kobe 5 'Lower Merion Aces Home' pays tribute to Kobe Bryant's high school, located outside of Philadelphia. As a senior, Bryant claimed multiple national player of the year awards and All-American honors. Released in 2010, this low top shoe proudly displays Lower Merion's colors—white, Team Red and Metallic Silver—with an 'Ace' graphic on the heel and Bryant's signature below it. Its silhouette remains true to the original Zoom Kobe 5 and its lighter, sleeker design that prioritizes performance.
