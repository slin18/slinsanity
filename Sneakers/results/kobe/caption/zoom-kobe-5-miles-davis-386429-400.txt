Zoom Kobe 5 'Miles Davis' | SKU: 386429 400 | Released: 2010-06-16


The Nike Zoom Kobe 5 ‘Miles Davis’ nods to the jazz trumpeter’s legendary studio album with a vibrant blue finish on the glossy synthetic upper, reinforced with tonal heat-bonded overlays and crisscrossing Flywire cables. The low-top is mounted on a contrasting black phylon-injected midsole, embedded with Zoom Air units in the forefoot and heel. Underfoot, a heartbeat-inspired traction pattern is featured on the rubber outsole, reflecting Kobe’s passion for the game.
