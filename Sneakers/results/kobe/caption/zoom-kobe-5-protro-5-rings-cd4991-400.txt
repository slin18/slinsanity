Zoom Kobe 5 Protro '5 Rings' | SKU: CD4991 400 | Released: 2020-10-15


The Nike Zoom Kobe 5 Protro ‘5 Rings’ brings back a celebratory Kobe 5 colorway that originally launched in summer 2010 in recognition of the Mamba’s fifth championship with the Los Angeles Lakers. The low-top makes use of a simple palette in Concord and Midwest Gold, executed on a streamlined upper covered in various graphics centered around the number 5. A gradient two-tone midsole packs Zoom Air cushioning in both the heel and forefoot.
