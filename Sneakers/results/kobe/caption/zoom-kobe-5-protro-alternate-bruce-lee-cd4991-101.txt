Zoom Kobe 5 Protro 'Alternate Bruce Lee' | SKU: CD4991 101 | Released: 2020-11-24


The Nike Zoom Kobe 5 Protro ‘Alternate Bruce Lee’ pays homage to the iconic martial artist with a design that takes its cues from the 2010 colorway inspired by Lee’s jumpsuit from ‘Enter the Dragon.’ The black and white color scheme adds yellow accents in a nod to the original, along with the distinctive red scratch marks on the lateral forefoot. While the original Zoom Kobe 5 featured Zoom Air cushioning in the forefoot and heel, this pair utilizes a large-volume Zoom Air unit only in the forefoot.
