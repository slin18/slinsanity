Zoom Kobe 5 Protro ‘Bruce Lee’ | SKU: CD4991 700 | Released: 2020-11-24


The Nike Zoom Kobe 5 Protro ‘Bruce Lee’ brings back a beloved 2010 colorway inspired by the martial artist whose style and mindset informed Kobe Bryant’s play on the hardwood. The yellow and black design — complete with red scratch marks on the lateral forefoot — give the nod to Bruce Lee’s jumpsuit from his iconic film ‘Enter the Dragon.’ In terms of performance, the lightweight build utilizes Nike’s Flywire technology throughout the upper, supported by a foam midsole housing a large-volume Zoom Air unit in the forefoot.
