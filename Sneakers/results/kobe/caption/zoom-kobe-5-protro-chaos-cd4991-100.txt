Zoom Kobe 5 Protro 'Chaos' | SKU: CD4991 100 | Released: 2020-01-03


Celebrating its 10th anniversary, the Nike Zoom Kobe 5 Protro returns in January 2020 with inspiration taken from DC Comics supervillain, the Joker. This 'Chaos' edition evokes the character's iconic suit in a multi-color, mixed-material upper flaunting lizard skin textures, flecked laces and a protective toe cap while neon branding recalls his green hair. The sneaker carries a splattered midsole and color-pop rubber outsole.
