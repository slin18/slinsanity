Zoom Kobe 5 Protro 'EYBL' | SKU: CD4991 300 | Released: 2020-08-29


The Nike Zoom Kobe 5 Protro ‘EYBL’ is taken from a special 2020 collection that launched as part of Mamba Week, a weeklong celebration of Kobe Bryant’s legacy that kicked off on the athlete’s birthday, August 23. The low-top draws inspiration from Greek mythology, featuring a scaly texture on a dark green synthetic upper that conjures images of the villainous Medusa. Nike’s EYBL logo adorns the tongue of the left shoe, while Kobe’s personal logo graces the opposite tongue.
