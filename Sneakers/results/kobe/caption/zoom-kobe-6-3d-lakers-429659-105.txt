Zoom Kobe 6 '3D Lakers' | SKU: 429659 105 | Released: 2011-11-02


The Nike Zoom Kobe 6 ‘3D Lakers’ updates Kobe Bryant’s sixth signature shoe with a design inspired by LA’s storied NBA franchise. A lenticular 3D effect distinguishes the upper, rendered in grey with the Lakers’ signature purple and gold. The latter hues are applied in mismatched fashion to the laces, TPU heel counter and rubber outsole, featuring a Black Mamba-inspired traction pattern for superior grip on the hardwood.
