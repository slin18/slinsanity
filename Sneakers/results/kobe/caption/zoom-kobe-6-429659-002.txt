Zoom Kobe 6 'Black Del Sol' | SKU: 429659 002 | Released: 2010-12-26


Nike debuted the Zoom Kobe 6 in December 2010 in this inaugural colorway, featuring a mesh upper with countless polyurethane ‘islands’ to create a unique texture resembling snakeskin. The all-black coloring up top is accented by a yellow Swoosh as well as Kobe’s signature on the molded heel panel. A tonal black, Phylon-injected midsole houses Zoom Air units in the heel and forefoot for responsive cushioning.
