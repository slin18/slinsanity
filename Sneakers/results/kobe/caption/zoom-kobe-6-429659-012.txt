Zoom Kobe 6 'Wolf Grey' | SKU: 429659 012 | Released: 2011-07-01


Debuted in 2011, the Zoom Kobe 6 is distinguished by the bold serpentine texture adorning its low-cut upper. In addition to a debossed “VENOMENON” logo on the toe, the metallic silver snake-like pattern is accentuated by white details like Kobe’s Shozoku logo on the tongue, side Swooshes, and heel signatures. Performance features include Flywire technology for a custom fit and a midsole with Zoom Air in the heel and forefoot for responsiveness.
