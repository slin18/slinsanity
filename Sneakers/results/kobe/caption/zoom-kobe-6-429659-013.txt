Zoom Kobe 6 'Blackout' | SKU: 429659 013 | Released: 2011-07-20


The Nike Zoom Kobe 6 ‘Blackout’ features muted black and grey tones throughout the lightweight shoe’s exterior. The one-piece upper is entirely covered in polyurethane ‘islands’ for enhanced durability, while the resulting scaly texture draws a connection to Kobe Bryant’s Black Mamba persona. Additional performance benefits include supportive Flywire technology, a dual-layer memory foam sockliner and a phylon-injected midsole with Zoom Air units in both the heel and forefoot.
