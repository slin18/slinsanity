Zoom Kobe 6 'Imperial Purple' | SKU: 429659 501 | Released: 2011-09-01


The Nike Zoom Kobe 6 taps into Kobe Bryant’s ‘Black Mamba’ nickname, accenting the upper with a snakeskin texture on the synthetic paneling. Rendered in Imperial Purple, contrasting Del Sol accents emerge on the tongue, branding and outsole to round out the Los Angeles Lakers colors. Flywire cables and Nike Zoom technology promote a locked-down fit and responsive cushioning.
