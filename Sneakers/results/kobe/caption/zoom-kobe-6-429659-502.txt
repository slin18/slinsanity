Zoom Kobe 6 'Lakers Gradient' | SKU: 429659 502 | Released: 2011-11-02


The Nike Zoom Kobe 6 ‘Lakers Gradient’ dresses Kobe Bryant’s sixth signature shoe with the colors of the only NBA franchise that the Mamba called home. Covered in polyurethane ‘islands,’ the scaly upper is finished in a unique color-fade effect using the Lakers’ trademark purple and gold hues. A contrasting white Swoosh adorns the side panel, matching the phylon-injected midsole housing Zoom Air units in both the heel and forefoot.
