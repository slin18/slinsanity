Zoom Kobe 6 'Think Pink' | SKU: 429659 601 | Released: 2011-08-26


In August 2011, Nike did its part to raise breast cancer awareness, donating all proceeds from a series of ‘Think Pink’ silhouettes including this Zoom Kobe 6. The “snakeskin” design is dressed in a bold Pinkfire hue with hits of metallic silver. A single pink ribbon logo at the heel of each shoe pays tribute to the cause and represents the strength of women worldwide.
