Zoom Kobe 6 'All Star - 3D Hollywood' | SKU: 448693 001 | Released: 2011-02-17


The 2011 NBA All-Star Game was held in Los Angeles and to commemorate the occasion, three different Kobe 6 All-Star editions were made. This ‘Hollywood’ rendition of the Kobe 6 features red and cyan accents on the branding and componentry of the mismatched shoes to not only represent the annual East-West showdown, but the materials on the upper give a 3-Dimensional look and feel. Inside the tongue a graphic of a pair of 3D glasses ties it all together.
