Designed by Eric Avar, the Nike Zoom Kobe 6 was worn by Kobe Bryant during the 2010-2011 NBA season. The upper sports a textured polyurethane construction inspired by snakeskin, recalling Bryant’s ‘Black Mamba’ nickname, which is supported by a Phylon-injected midsole and Zoom Air units in the heel and forefoot. The Kobe 6 ‘Barcelona’ sports the home colors of Spanish soccer club FC Barcelona, a tribute to Bryant’s passion for soccer while growing up in Italy.
