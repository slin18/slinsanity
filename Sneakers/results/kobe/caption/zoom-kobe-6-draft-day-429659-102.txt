Zoom Kobe 6 'Draft Day' | SKU: 429659 102 | Released: 2011-05-26


The 1996 NBA Draft saw the Charlotte Hornets trade the 13th overall pick to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for center Vlade Divac. The Lakers would use that pick to select Kobe Bryant, and to pay tribute to those events, the Zoom Kobe 6 ‘Draft Day’ emerges in a Hornets-inspired colorway. The white snakeskin-textured upper is accented by a Varsity Purple Swoosh and laces, while Photo Blue emerges on the heel counter, lining and midsole.
