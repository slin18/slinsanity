Zoom Kobe 6 'Duke' | SKU: 429659 400 | Released: 2011-03-05


The Zoom Kobe 6 debuted this royal blue colorway, unofficially known as ‘Duke,’ in February 2011. In a color scheme reminiscent of the Blue Devils jersey, the design is a nod to what would have been his alma mater if he went to college instead of the NBA directly. It features a snake-textured polyurethane upper with black accents across the tongue, lacing, and heel atop a white Zoom cushioned midsole and blue outsole.
