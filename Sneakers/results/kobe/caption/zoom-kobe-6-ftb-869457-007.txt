Zoom Kobe 6 'Fade To Black' | SKU: 869457 007 | Released: 2016-04-05


In honor of Kobe Bryant’s retirement from the NBA, Nike released a thirteen pair ‘Fade to Black’ collection. The Zoom Kobe 6 'FTB' was designed in response to Bryant’s visit to Manila where he played a pick-up game with some locals. The sneaker features River Rock snakeskin designs on the upper with a synthetic heel counter for support and a leather branded tongue. The low top also sports Zoom Air technology in the midsole for energy-returning cushioning.
