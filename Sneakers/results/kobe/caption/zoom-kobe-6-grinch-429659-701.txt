Zoom Kobe 6 'Grinch' | SKU: 429659 701 | Released: 2010-12-25


The Nike Zoom Kobe 6 ‘Grinch’ launched Christmas Day in 2010, featuring a Green Apple colorway that calls to mind to the Dr. Seuss character with a penchant for ruining everyone’s famous December holiday. However the real inspiration behind this colorway is the deadly Green Mamba snake, with green scales and deep black eyes which can be seen on the scaly Mamba-inspired texture on the upper, with a contrasting black Swoosh. Red accents tie together the Christmas theme, highlighted with Kobe Bryant’s logo in red atop the tongue.
