Zoom Kobe 6 Protro 'All Star' | SKU: DH9888 600 | Released: 2021-03-15


The Nike Zoom Kobe 6 Protro ‘All Star’ brings back a special-edition colorway that the Mamba himself wore at the 2011 NBA All-Star Game. This updated version of the classic low-top features revised tooling, highlighted by a full-length Cushlon midsole with a large Air Zoom Turbo unit in the forefoot. Up top, polyurethane scales improve the durability of the micro-mesh build, finished in a gradient blend of red and black. Kobe’s signature is printed on the molded heel counter, while his personal logo adorns the tongue.
