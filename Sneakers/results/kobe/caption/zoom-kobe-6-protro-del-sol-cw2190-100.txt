Zoom Kobe 6 Protro 'White Del Sol' | SKU: CW2190 100 | Released: 2021-06-14


The Nike Zoom Kobe 6 Protro ‘White Del Sol’ brings back the original ‘POP’ colorway from 2011, updated with refreshed tooling and a sleeker shape. Polyurethane ‘islands’ create a scaly texture on the white and grey upper, fortified with a black molded heel counter and accented with a matching black Swoosh. The Cushlon midsole packs a large and flexible Air Zoom Turbo unit in the forefoot, along with a softer foam compound in the heel. Underfoot, the rubber outsole features a snakeskin-inspired traction pattern for maximum grip.
