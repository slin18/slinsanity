Zoom Kobe 6 Protro 'Mambacita Sweet Sixteen' | SKU: CW2190 002 | Released: 2022-05-01


The Nike Kobe 6 Protro 'Mambacita Sweet Sixteen' pays tribute to Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gigi. Black snake scales on the upper reference Bryant's Black Mamba alter ego. Notes of white appear on the Swoosh, tongue logo and leather back panels. The heel mold swaps out the traditional Kobe signature for the Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation crest, with "Kobe" and "Gigi" inscribed on the left and right shoe, respectively. A gilded "2" on the lateral window represents Gigi's AAU uniform number. The insoles further honor Gigi with a design that features angel wings, a halo, the nickname "Mambacita" and another "2."
