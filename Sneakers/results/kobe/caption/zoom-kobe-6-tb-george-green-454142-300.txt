Zoom Kobe 6 TB 'Gorge Green' | SKU: 454142 300 | Released: 2011-07-01


The Nike Zoom Kobe 6 TB 'Gorge Green' provides Kobe Bryant's sixth signature sneaker with a Team Bank colorway of Gorge Green, white and Metallic Silver. This shoe stays true to the original Zoom Kobe 6, which was designed by Eric Avar and released during the 2010â€“11 NBA season. Much of the premium upper is covered in green with a snakeskin-like design, a tribute to the Black Mamba. White takes over the Nike Swoosh, heel counter and midsole, which includes a pair of Nike Zoom units to promote cushioning and responsiveness.
