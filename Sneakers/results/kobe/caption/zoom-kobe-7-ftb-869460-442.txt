Zoom Kobe 7 'Fade To Black' | SKU: 869460 442 | Released: 2016-04-06


This Nike Zoom Kobe 7 'FTB' sports a monochromatic Blue Fox colorway. Bryant wore the Kobe 7 at the 2012 All Star Game, scoring 27 points to overtake Michael Jordan as the leading scorer in All-Star history. The Kobe 7 also helped him win his second Gold Medal for Team USA at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. This colorway dropped as part of Kobe’s ‘Fade to Black’ / ‘Black Mamba’ collection. The 13-part collection released special edition colorways for the entire Kobe signature shoe line, as well as the Hyperdunk and Huarache 2k4, leading up to Kobe’s last game in the NBA in April 2016.
