Zoom Kobe 7 System 'Shark' | SKU: 488371 401 | Released: 2012-02-15


Inspired by the characteristics of the shark and how they translate to Kobe Bryant’s performance on court, the Zoom Kobe 7 features an ocean graphic throughout the shoe’s exterior shell that forms a skin-like texture to mimic the look of the predatory creature. A Cushlon midsole allows players to propel their strides with a faster response and protects against harsh impact on the court.
