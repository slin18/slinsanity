Zoom Kobe 7 Supreme X 'Del Sol' | SKU: 488369 001 | Released: 2011-12-23


The Nike Zoom Kobe 7 Supreme X gives Kobe Bryant's seventh signature shoe a color scheme of black, white and Del Sol. Released in December 2011 and designed by Eric Avar, the sneaker is customizable based on one's style of play. The 'Attack Fast' midsole insert possesses Nike's Zoom Air in the forefoot and heel, while the 'Attack Strong' option is comprised of Cushlon and does not contain air. The shoe's upper displays the Swoosh in silver and contains a cast polyurethane outer shell with a pattern inspired by three predators—the leopard, great white shark and of course—the black mamba.
