Zoom Kobe 7 System 'Prelude' | SKU: 639692 001 | Released: 2014-01-18


In celebration of Kobe Bryant’s win as part of Team USA at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Nike released a pack that matches eight critical art movements to eight milestones in Bryant’s career. The Zoom Kobe 7 System 'Prelude' features Cubist-inspired graphics on the upper which reference the leopard, the great white shark, and the black mamba—all three animals that mirror Bryant’s instinct on the court. The sneaker also sports a speckled midsole, synthetic black accents on the ankle for support, and a gold heel wrap as a nod to his Olympic win.
