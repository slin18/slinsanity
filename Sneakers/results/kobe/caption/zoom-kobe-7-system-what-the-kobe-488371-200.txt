Zoom Kobe 7 System 'What The Kobe' | SKU: 488371 200 | Released: 2012-07-07


The Kobe 7 System comes with two interchangeable insert options allowing players to switch out the cushioning and ankle support to match their style of play. The ‘Attack Fast’ insert includes a Phylon midsole with Nike Zoom units in the forefoot and heel for lightweight responsiveness, and the ‘Attack Strong’ offers more protection and support with its full-length Cushlon midsole and padded ankle cuff. This ‘What The Kobe’ model, inspired by the mash-up concept first introduced by Nike SB in 2007, blends together several different Kobe 7 colorways including the Mamba Snake, Cheetah, Poison Dart Frog, and Shark. Other details include Kevlar Flywire technology and a carbon fiber external heel counter.
