Zoom Kobe 7 System 'Yin And Yang' | SKU: 488371 501 | Released: 2012-11-17


The Nike Zoom Kobe 7 System ‘Yin And Yang’ gets its name from the opposing purple and gold color blocking between the left and right shoes. The net effect is to bring together both ‘home’ and ‘away’ Lakers themes on the pair. Aside from its split colorway, the Zoom Kobe 7 System features Flywire technology for a locked-down fit and a 3D heel clip for enhanced support.
