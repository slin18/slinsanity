Zoom Kobe 7 X 'Great White Shark' | SKU: 488370 401 | Released: 2012-02-14


The Nike Zoom Kobe 7 X 'Great White Shark' takes the predator theme of Kobe Bryant's seventh signature sneaker into the depths of the ocean. Released in February 2012 with a cool-toned colorway, this shoe's upper dives into the deep sea with various shades of blue for an underwater feel. Bryant's Nike 'Sheath' branding resides on the tongue and the iconic Swoosh lives on the quarter panel, both in white. A shark graphic is displayed on the heel, just below Kobe's signature. A highly durable XDR outsole in blue finishes the style.
