Zoom Kobe Venomenon 4 'Glow In The Dark' | SKU: 635578 003 | Released: nan


The low-profile Zoom Kobe Venomenon 4 'Glow In The Dark' is a bold take on the December 2013 signature sneaker from Kobe Bryant. Its mesh upper is primarily black, with a rich red lining the collar, tongue, and heel branding. The heel is outfitted with a synthetic overlay that boasts a glistening purple hue. At the bottom, the shoe is underscored by a glow-in-the-dark sole which gives the sneaker its name.
